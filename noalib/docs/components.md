# Component notes

Reference list of components, what they do, and order in which they're called.

Order for systems on custom components can be specified with an `order` property
in the component definition. For example, if you define a component with a
`renderSystem` that depends on the current camera target position, it will want an
`order` greater than `50` (when `followsEntity` moves the camera target before each render).

## All components

| name              | order | desc                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `collideEntities` | `70`  | marks entities that collide with other entities                             |
| `collideTerrain`  |       | marks entities that collide with terrain                                    |
| `fadeOnZoom`      | `99`  | marks an entity to hide when camera is zoomed in                            |
| `followsEntity`   | `50`  | locks location of an entity to another one                                  |
| `mesh`            | `100` | stores a mesh associated with an entity                                     |
| `movement`        | `30`  | stores movement state (move direction, jumping, etc.)                       |
| `physics`         | `40`  | stores an entity's physics body                                             |
| `position`        |       | stores entity's position, height/weight, and related data                   |
| `receivesInputs`  | `20`  | marks an entity as being controlled by keyboard/mouse                       |
| `shadow`          | `80`  | stores and manages a shadow mesh for an entity                              |
| `smoothCamera`    | `99`  | marks a mesh to move smoothly to its physics position, rather than abruptly |

## Component `system` handlers and order

| name              | order | system                                           |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `receivesInputs`  | `20`  | update `movement` state based on key/mouse input |
| `movement`        | `30`  | applies physics forces based on `movement` state |
| `physics`         | `40`  | update entity `_localPosition` from physics body |
| `followsEntity`   | `50`  | move own `_localPosition` to match target        |
| `position`        | `60`  | update `position` and `extents` properties       |
| `collideEntities` | `70`  | runs collision test, fires onCollide events      |
| `shadow`          | `80`  | update shadow's `y` position                     |
| `fadeOnZoom`      | `99`  | checks camera zoom, hides or reveals entity      |
| `smoothCamera`    | `99`  | removes itself after time limit                  |

## Component `renderSystem` handlers and order

| name            | order | render system                                              |
| --------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `physics`       | `40`  | backtrack entity `renderPosition` towards physics position |
| `followsEntity` | `50`  | moves entity's `renderPosition` to match its follow target |
| `shadow`        | `80`  | update shadow's `x/z` position                             |
| `mesh`          | `100` | moves rendering mesh to entity `renderPosition`            |
