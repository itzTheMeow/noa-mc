# Q & A

- ### What devices have you tested this on?
  - Firefox on iOS 12 (equivalent to safari 12)
  - Firefox on Windows 10 (v91)
  - Occasionally using Chrome on Windows 10 (v93)
  - _If something doesn't work right (blank page, console errors, etc) make an issue with your device and browser version/name._

---

- ### Why did you make this?
  - I wanted to make something better than the official classic port. The controls are kinda weird and it's prone to bugs.

---

- ### Is this against Mojang's Terms?
  - No, i'm following everything [here](https://account.mojang.com/terms#brand).
  - This is not for a commercial use.
  - I'm not making money off of this.
  - I'm not giving away copies of Minecraft.
  - I'm not "letting other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable" as far as i know.
